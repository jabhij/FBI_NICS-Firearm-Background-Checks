 - Description- The NICS conducts background checks on people who want to own a firearm or explosive, as required by law.
 
 ## What this data is about?
When someone wants to purchase a firearm, they typically visit a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), who is the seller. The buyer fills out an ATF form, and the FFL contacts the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to conduct a background check on the buyer. If the check reveals that the buyer has a criminal record or is otherwise not allowed to own a firearm, the sale will be denied. Since it was established in 1998, NICS has conducted over 300 million background checks, resulting in more than 1.5 million denials.
